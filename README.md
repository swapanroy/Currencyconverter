# Currencyconverter
Python code to pull live currency data 

*Concept:* 
1.	Create a space for user input ( in our case USD is the base currency that needs to be converted into other currencies)
2.	Use API to fetch data and parse it.
3.	Present the data on the UI screen. 

Below is the process that I followed 
1.	Using Python 3.9 (Latest version) -download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
2.	Use  tkinter library for UI (pip install tkinter )
3.	Use request library to pull data via API
4. Create buttons like “Convert” to fetch data and Clear to erase the content
